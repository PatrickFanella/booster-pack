# PokeAPI Funtimes
---

so far it's just a pokemon card.  I was hoping to be able to make a booster pack opener with teh correct odds and all of that, but I don't think the api gives me enough info.  I am considering making it a battle simulator that creates a pool of pokemon from the api and does a pokemon stadium kind of deal.
